Our testing strategy for directory and file queues was including multi-layered
directories. This was to make sure our program was correctly going into
directories and adding path names with proper suffixes to the queues. Testing
the queue, we added and removed items and tested when the queue was empty.

Our testing strategy for WFD was to vary the number of words and the frequency
of those words within text files and compare them to basic calculations that
could be done on a calculator. The results proved accurate. We also tested
empty files, files with only spaces, punctuations, and numbers.
